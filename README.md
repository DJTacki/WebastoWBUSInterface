# WebastoWBUSInterface

Hardware circuit and diagram for interfacing to the Webasto WBUS interface from a PC/Arduino

This small circuit allows you to connect a 5 volt device with a serial port to a Webasto Heater which communicates in the WBUS protocol.

The circuit expects you to connect a FT232R USB Serial to TTL interface, or a micro controller such as the Arduino.



Have fun!
